STORY_TEXT = """:OUTWARD:
Welcome to Mars. You have been selected as one of the few chosen to
create a small colony on Mars. You won't stay here long though.

The sun is growing quickly and it'll soon reach earth!

Within one year on mars, you need to collect as many resources as possible
and at the same time, grow your population, mine ores and produce food and
water to create new colonies in other parts of the galaxy.

Notice, others also try to do achieve the same and everyone wants to get
the leadership.

And beware, your opponents are not the only danger that lies out there, solar
storms, earthquakes and more will hit you.

But I trust in you, you'll be the one to save us!

A Friend - 330 A.S.E.
