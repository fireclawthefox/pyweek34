STORY_TEXT = """:OUTWARD:
Welcome to Mars. You have been selected as one of the few chosen to
create a small colony on Mars. You won't stay here long though.

The sun is growing quickly and it'll soon reach earth!

Within one year on mars, you need to collect as many resources as possible
and at the same time, grow your population, mine ores and produce food and
water to create new colonies in other parts of the galaxy.

Notice, others also try to do achieve the same and everyone wants to get
the leadership.

And beware, your opponents are not the only danger that lies out there, solar
storms, earthquakes and more will hit you.

But I trust in you, you'll be the one to save us!

A Friend - 330 A.S.E.

Congratulations friend! You made it, you survived the red planet!

I knew I've put my trusted in the right one. Now out we go, out to new planets to
conquer, planets that our civilisation can thrive on.

We're heading to something great.
As they once said, "the sky is the limit" but not for us, not this time.

Let's just hope this galaxy is ready for us...

Argh how could they, beat us!? No, that can't be, let's get them again...

But, we can't... Noooo, we're doomed!

How could we loose against them? I thought I've got the right person at hand.

But, no, sorry, it's not your fault. Well I think it's time to part.

Farwell... My friend...
